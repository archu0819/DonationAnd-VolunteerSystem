Introduction to the System:

	Donation Management Project System is a mission to end hunger and no wasting of food and other needy items to make a hungry-free world.
	In the current working scenario, many NGOs are struggling with some issues mainly communication with their member, heads and volunteer while NGO are donating.
	The focus of this project is to reduce the amount of wastage of needy items and being used to the needy people.	 

Problem Definition:
Presently people who wish to donate items need to personally visit the organizations and donate foods or other items. Otherwise, they have to search for some websites to donate needy items. In general, the large manufacturers, wholesalers, and organized community provide food items to food banks or waste tons of foods daily. They have to search for some organization that needs food. This process involves a lot of time to contact the organization to check the requirement. If they do not need the food, then the person has to contact another organization. This makes the donor tired and exhausted.
